## we “watch” the makerspace [on-chain]
* using a laser beam sensor
* we then use our dark layer, iot wifi datastore http magic
* to fetch data of # of people passing into and out of the maker space every 30min
* and publish on the blockchain (using chainlink's token / api)
* the-graph fetches this from the blockchain
* allowing us to publish is before your very eyes
